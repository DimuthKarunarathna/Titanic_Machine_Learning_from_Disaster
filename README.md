# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their personal attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare. The model uses the well-known Titanic dataset from Kaggle and demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and submission generation.

## Dataset
The project uses three main files from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data):
- `train.csv` - Training data containing passenger features and survival labels.
- `test.csv` - Test data for which survival predictions are to be made.
- `gender_submission.csv` - Sample submission file for format reference.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked`, and scale features if necessary.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Select important features such as `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, and `Embarked`.
   
3. **Model Training**  
   Train a Random Forest Classifier on the processed training data.
   
4. **Prediction & Submission**  
   Predict survival for the test set and generate a `submission.csv` file for Kaggle submission.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-ml.git
    cd titanic-ml
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the project folder.

4. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python titanic_model.py
    ```

5. The output `submission.csv` will be generated for Kaggle submission.

## Files
- `titanic_model.py` - Main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `submission.csv` - The prediction file to upload on Kaggle.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the Kaggle leaderboard (you can replace with your actual score).
